# mod_contact

I miss this module in Joomla packed, while decide to create it self.
Everybody is free to develop om this module, so it can be god enough to be in the packed for Joomla distributet.

# functions
This module list contacts from com_contacts in the module, so you can desplay them where you want.

In my case, I want to have some widget on the frontpage with different contents.
They other contents, there was a module to get, but not for Contacts

## in the config, you can define which field from contacts yoy want to display in the module
